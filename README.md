## FootPredict âš½
Predict English Premier League Football match winners using Machine learning and Python libraries.
**P.S. Arsenal all the way!!!**

## Idea: 
- Scrap match data with requests and beautifulsoup/pandas
- Clean the data for machine learning
- Create models and train/test them to make predictions about the winners
- Measure any accuracy, error and improve mode/predictions

## Files:
* `scrape_match.ipynb` - a Jupyter notebook that scrapes the football data.
* `football_prediction.ipynb` - a Jupyter notebook that makes predictions on W/L.
